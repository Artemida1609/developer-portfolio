## 🧩 Code Style

To keep the project consistent and maintainable:

* Use **Prettier** or **ESLint** to format your code before committing.
* Prefer **functional components** and **React Hooks** over class components.
* Use **TypeScript** types and interfaces where possible.
* Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a reference.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Keep components small and reusable.
* Commit messages should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

  * `feat:` — a new feature
  * `fix:` — a bug fix
  * `docs:` — documentation only changes
  * `style:` — formatting or styling updates
  * `refactor:` — code improvements without changing behavior

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that your branch is **up-to-date** with the `main` branch.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
2. Make sure all **linting and build checks** pass before submitting.
3. Keep your PR focused on a single issue or feature — smaller PRs are easier to review.
4. Include **screenshots or GIFs** if your changes affect the UI.
5. Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request. Be open to feedback and requested changes.

## 🐛 Issue Reporting

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest an enhancement:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the [Issues](../../issues) tab.
2. If not, create a **new issue** with:

   * A clear title and description.
   * Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug).
   * Expected vs. actual behavior.
   * Screenshots, if applicable.
3. Label your issue appropriately (`bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, etc.).
